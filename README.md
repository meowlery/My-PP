# My PP

“My PP” is a macropad that I designed with 9 keys. PP stands for “Personal Pad”, since it has my personal features that I use most. You probably noticed that it’s a reference to “PC”, which stands for “Personal Computer” (; (i know it's very random)

## Notes:

I built this macropad using a Hack Club tutorial, and it was really fun. Unfortunately, I couldn’t make a screenshot of the overall macropad. I struggled for more than three hours trying to figure out how to put the parts together using Autodesk Fusion. It was also very difficult to find a good tutorial for that and my laptop is very slow, this makes things way more complicated. I really hope that the project still gets approved, because I put hours of work into it and did my best.

## Challenges:

Other than that everything else went pretty well and with YouTube and Google I didn't have a problem that I couldn't solve.

### BOM:

Here are the things that are inside my macropad:
