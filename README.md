# My PP

“My PP” is a macropad that I designed with 9 keys. PP stands for “Personal Pad”, since it has my personal features that I use most. You probably noticed that it’s a reference to “PC”, which stands for “Personal Computer” (; (i know it's very random)

## Notes:

I built this macropad using a Hack Club tutorial, and it was really fun. Here is how the final product will look liike after building the parts together:

## Challenges:

With designing this macropad I learned many things which was really cool. For example I designed a PCB for the first time! I already have an arduino with a breadboard for some small projects and I wondered many times about how to design a PCB but thought it was way more difficult than it actually is. And I created for the first time something in 3D with Fusion360.

## Programs I used:

- Fusion360 for CAD
- KiCad for the PCB
- QMK Firmware for the firmware (did I need to explain it?)

### BOM:

Here are the things that are inside my macropad:

- 4x M3 Heatset
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 2x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 9x Cherry MX Switches
